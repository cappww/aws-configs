# Route Table
  # Each subnet must be associated with a route table
  # If the subnets route table does not route to an internet gateway, then it is a private subnet

# Internet gateway
  # Provides a target in the vpc route table for internet-routable traffic
  # Perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses
  # Only one IGW per VPC

# Bastions aka Jumpboxes
  # Public subnet ec2 instances that are used to access private subnet ec2 instances
  # This architecture includes a NAT Gateway in order to function, refer to 01:22:08 for diagram
  # AWS already has a feature that does this functionality called Sessions Manager

# Direct Connect
  # Establishes a dedicated network connection to an on-prem location

# VPC Endpoints
  # Allows the vpc to connect to other AWS services without leaving the AWS network
  # Three types: interface endpoints, gateway endpoints, Gateway load balancer endpoints
  # Interface Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
    # An Elastic Network Interface with a private IP, serving as an entry point for traffic going to a supported service
  # Gateway Endpoints
    # Target for a specific route in the route table, used for traffic destined for a supported AWS service
    # Supports a limited number of services: S3 and DynamoDB
    # Network Address Translation
  # Method of remapping one IP address to another
  # Used if a private subnet needs access to the internet, maps the private IPs to public IPs
  # Can also be used when two subnets have colliding IPs

# NAT Instances (legacy)
  # Individual ec2 instance
  # Have to run in a public subnet

# NAT Gateways
  # Managed service for a given AZ
  # Only one NAT Gateway per AZ
  # Automatically assigned a public IP Address

# NACL
  # Come with VPCs by default
  # It can allow or deny traffic into and out of subnets
  # It can deny ports and IPs
  # Each subnet must have exactly one nacl

# Security Groups
  # Virtual firewall at the instance level
  
# VPC Flow Logs
  # Captures traffic information
  # Stored in AWS CloudWatch Logs or s3 buckets
  # Stored source IP address and destination IP Addresses
